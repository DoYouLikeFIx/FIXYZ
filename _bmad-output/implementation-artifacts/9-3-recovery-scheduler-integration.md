# Story 9.3: [INT/CH] Recovery Scheduler Integration

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a reliability owner,
I want orchestrated recovery for EXECUTING/UNKNOWN transfers,
So that stuck transactions eventually converge.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given transfer remains non-terminal beyond threshold When scheduler runs Then recovery sequence is triggered.
2. Given external requery returns terminal result When reconciliation succeeds Then transfer is closed with normalized state.
3. Given repeated unresolved attempts When max tries exceeded Then manual recovery queue entry is created.
4. Given recovery execution When audited Then attempt history is queryable.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 1 (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 1
- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 2 (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 2
- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 3 (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 3
- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 4 (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 4

## Dev Notes

### Developer Context Section

- Canonical numbering source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` Epic 9.
- No supplemental epic artifact detected for this epic at generation time.
- Depends on: Story 9.1, Story 6.4.

### Technical Requirements

- Implement only the scope defined in this story's acceptance criteria.
- Keep API, error, and ownership semantics consistent with architecture and PRD contracts.
- Avoid cross-lane coupling outside required integration boundaries.

### Architecture Compliance

- Follow architecture-defined module boundaries, security contracts, and error envelope conventions.
- Keep lane ownership explicit (BE/FE/MOB) and avoid logic duplication across clients/services.

### Testing Requirements

- Validate all acceptance criteria with automated tests (unit/integration/e2e as appropriate).
- Ensure negative paths and validation/authorization/error flows are covered.

### Story Completion Status

- Status set to `ready-for-dev`.
- Completion note: Epic 9 story context prepared from canonical planning artifact.
