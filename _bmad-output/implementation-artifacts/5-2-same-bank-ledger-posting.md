# Story 5.2: [AC] Same-bank Ledger Posting

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a ledger engine,
I want atomic debit/credit posting for same-bank transfers,
So that ledger integrity is preserved.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given authorized transfer execution When posting occurs Then paired debit/credit entries are committed atomically.
2. Given posting failure mid-transaction When transaction aborts Then neither partial ledger entry persists.
3. Given insufficient balance condition When posting pre-check fails Then no ledger mutation occurs.
4. Given successful posting When response is built Then transaction reference is included.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 1 (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 1
- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 2 (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 2
- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 3 (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 3
- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 4 (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 4

## Dev Notes

### Developer Context Section

- Canonical numbering source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` Epic 5.
- Supplemental artifact `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/epic-5-real-time-notifications.md` has different scope/numbering; use it only as technical reference, not story ID authority.
- Depends on: Story 5.1, Story 4.3.

### Technical Requirements

- Implement only the scope defined in this story's acceptance criteria.
- Keep API, error, and ownership semantics consistent with architecture and PRD contracts.
- Avoid cross-lane coupling outside required integration boundaries.

### Architecture Compliance

- Follow architecture-defined module boundaries, security contracts, and error envelope conventions.
- Keep lane ownership explicit (BE/FE/MOB) and avoid logic duplication across clients/services.

### Testing Requirements

- Validate all acceptance criteria with automated tests (unit/integration/e2e as appropriate).
- Ensure negative paths and validation/authorization/error flows are covered.

### Story Completion Status

- Status set to `ready-for-dev`.
- Completion note: Epic 5 story context prepared from canonical planning artifact.
