# Story 8.3: [CH/FEP] Correlation-id 3-hop Propagation

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As an observability owner,
I want consistent correlation id propagation across CH -> AC -> FEP,
So that end-to-end traces are reconstructable.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given inbound request without correlation id When channel filter runs Then new id is generated and returned in response header.
2. Given internal downstream calls When channel calls account and FEP Then same correlation id is propagated.
3. Given log aggregation query When searching by correlation id Then all three services show traceable chain.
4. Given propagation regression test When CI runs Then 3-hop header assertions pass.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 1 (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 1
- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 2 (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 2
- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 3 (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 3
- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 4 (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 4

## Dev Notes

### Developer Context Section

- Canonical numbering source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` Epic 8.
- Supplemental artifact `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/epic-8-full-system-validation-and-acceptance-testing.md` has different scope/numbering; use it only as technical reference, not story ID authority.
- Depends on: Story 3.1, Story 2.2, Story 4.3.

### Technical Requirements

- Implement only the scope defined in this story's acceptance criteria.
- Keep API, error, and ownership semantics consistent with architecture and PRD contracts.
- Avoid cross-lane coupling outside required integration boundaries.

### Architecture Compliance

- Follow architecture-defined module boundaries, security contracts, and error envelope conventions.
- Keep lane ownership explicit (BE/FE/MOB) and avoid logic duplication across clients/services.

### Testing Requirements

- Validate all acceptance criteria with automated tests (unit/integration/e2e as appropriate).
- Ensure negative paths and validation/authorization/error flows are covered.

### Story Completion Status

- Status set to `ready-for-dev`.
- Completion note: Epic 8 story context prepared from canonical planning artifact.
