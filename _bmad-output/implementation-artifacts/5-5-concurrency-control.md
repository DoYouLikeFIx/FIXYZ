# Story 5.5: [AC] Concurrency Control

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a corebank integrity owner,
I want pessimistic locking and race-safe behavior,
So that concurrent transfers cannot produce negative or corrupted balances.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given concurrent transfer attempts on same account When lock policy is applied Then final balance never becomes negative.
2. Given lock contention When threshold exceeded Then request fails with deterministic conflict/error contract.
3. Given 10-thread concurrency test When executed in CI Then expected success/failure counts and final balance assertions pass.
4. Given lock duration observation When measured Then operational threshold alerting is available.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 1 (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 1
- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 2 (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 2
- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 3 (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 3
- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 4 (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 4

## Dev Notes

### Developer Context Section

- Canonical numbering source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` Epic 5.
- Supplemental artifact `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/epic-5-real-time-notifications.md` has different scope/numbering; use it only as technical reference, not story ID authority.
- Depends on: Story 5.2.

### Technical Requirements

- Implement only the scope defined in this story's acceptance criteria.
- Keep API, error, and ownership semantics consistent with architecture and PRD contracts.
- Avoid cross-lane coupling outside required integration boundaries.

### Architecture Compliance

- Follow architecture-defined module boundaries, security contracts, and error envelope conventions.
- Keep lane ownership explicit (BE/FE/MOB) and avoid logic duplication across clients/services.

### Testing Requirements

- Validate all acceptance criteria with automated tests (unit/integration/e2e as appropriate).
- Ensure negative paths and validation/authorization/error flows are covered.

### Story Completion Status

- Status set to `ready-for-dev`.
- Completion note: Epic 5 story context prepared from canonical planning artifact.
