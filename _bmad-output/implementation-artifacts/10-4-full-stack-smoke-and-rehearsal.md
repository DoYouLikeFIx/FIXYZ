# Story 10.4: [INT/CH] Full-stack Smoke & Rehearsal

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a release manager,
I want full-stack smoke and rehearsal flow,
So that deployment readiness is validated before production cut.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given fresh environment boot When compose stack starts Then health endpoints are green within threshold.
2. Given critical API/docs endpoints When smoke checks run Then mandatory endpoints respond correctly.
3. Given rollback rehearsal plan When exercise performed Then recovery procedure is executable and documented.
4. Given rehearsal completion When reviewed Then go/no-go checklist can be updated.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 1 (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 1
- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 2 (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 2
- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 3 (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 3
- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 4 (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 4

## Dev Notes

### Developer Context Section

- Canonical numbering source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` Epic 10.
- No supplemental epic artifact detected for this epic at generation time.
- Depends on: Story 10.1.

### Technical Requirements

- Implement only the scope defined in this story's acceptance criteria.
- Keep API, error, and ownership semantics consistent with architecture and PRD contracts.
- Avoid cross-lane coupling outside required integration boundaries.

### Architecture Compliance

- Follow architecture-defined module boundaries, security contracts, and error envelope conventions.
- Keep lane ownership explicit (BE/FE/MOB) and avoid logic duplication across clients/services.

### Testing Requirements

- Validate all acceptance criteria with automated tests (unit/integration/e2e as appropriate).
- Ensure negative paths and validation/authorization/error flows are covered.

### Story Completion Status

- Status set to `ready-for-dev`.
- Completion note: Epic 10 story context prepared from canonical planning artifact.
