# Story 5.7: Visible Result/Error UX

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As an order user,
I want limit/balance/result failures clearly explained,
So that I can take the correct next action.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given insufficient balance/limit errors When FE/MOB receives codes Then both clients show aligned actionable guidance.
2. Given order failure reason code When rendered Then reason category is distinguishable (internal/external/validation).
3. Given successful order completion When result rendered Then reference and updated balance context are shown where required.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 1 (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 1
- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 2 (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 2
- [ ] Implement acceptance-criteria scope 3 (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add test coverage for AC 3

## Dev Notes

### Developer Context Section

- Canonical numbering source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` Epic 5.
- Supplemental artifact `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/epic-5-real-time-notifications.md` has different scope/numbering; use it only as technical reference, not story ID authority.
- Depends on: Story 5.1, Story 4.8.

### Technical Requirements

- Implement only the scope defined in this story's acceptance criteria.
- Keep API, error, and ownership semantics consistent with architecture and PRD contracts.
- Avoid cross-lane coupling outside required integration boundaries.

### Architecture Compliance

- Follow architecture-defined module boundaries, security contracts, and error envelope conventions.
- Keep lane ownership explicit (BE/FE/MOB) and avoid logic duplication across clients/services.

### Testing Requirements

- Validate all acceptance criteria with automated tests (unit/integration/e2e as appropriate).
- Ensure negative paths and validation/authorization/error flows are covered.

### Story Completion Status

- Status set to `ready-for-dev`.
- Completion note: Epic 5 story context prepared from canonical planning artifact.
